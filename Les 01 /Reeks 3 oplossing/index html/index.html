		Ask an IT person if they know what Slashdot’s tagline is and they’ll reply, <q>News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters.</q> Slashdot is a very<br>
		prominent site, but underneath the hood you will find an old jalopy that could benefit from a web standards mechanic.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this article we will show how an engine overhaul could take place by converting a single Slashdot page from their current<br>
		HTML 3.2 code, nested tables, and invalid, nonsemantic markup, to a finely tuned web standards racing engine. The goal is not to
		<br>
		change Slashdot, but to rebuild it with web standards and show the benefits of the transition.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you panic because I’m picking on Slashdot, let me inform you that I asked Rob “CmdrTaco” Malda, the guru behind
		<br>
		Slashdot, for permission to post this information, and he stated in his reply email:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		Have fun. Feel free to submit patches back to us if you come up with anything useful. Slashdot's source code is open
		<br>
		source and available at <a href="#" title="www.slashcode.com">www.slashcode.com.</a>
	</blockquote>
	<h3>The breakdown</h3>
	<p>
		We started by freezing a copy of Slashdot on Tuesday July 22, 2003. Once we had a
		<a href="#" title="copy of the page">copy of the page</a>, the first step was to remove<br>
		all non-essential tags. The only tags left were anchors, lists, forms, images, scripts and header information. From the stripped down<br>
		version, the code was converted to XHTML 1.0 Transitional, and validated. At this point, the page looks like a minefield of links in<br>
		a sea of information. It’s valid, but not pretty to look at, so on to the next step.
	</p>
	<h3>The semantic conversion</h3>
	<p>
		While viewing the now-valid markup, it became apparent that most of the information would be better described as lists. For<br>
		example, the images for the categories of Slashdot were now just sitting next to each other. Essentially, anything that there was<br>
		more than two of was put it into a list, for example: login, sections, help, stories, about, services, etc. Lists can be
		described and<br>
		positioned in any way that we want, and by stating that elements are part of a list, we are describing their relationship to
		each other.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next step was to use header tags. The page has lots of titles and information, but none of the information was described<br>
		appropriately or explained its relationship to other bits of information. So we gave the title of an article an
		<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, the author<br>
		information an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, the department received an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, and the “read more” area an
		<code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>. This then uniquely identified each part of<br>
		information of an article, while describing the relationship of those parts. Then came the simple part: identify paragraphs, and
		clean<br>
		up the code.
	</p>
	<p>
		The benefit of the semantic conversion is that we are using tags for what they were meant for. It is clear that a list of objects<br>
		belongs together, and there is a title hierarchy. Another benefit is that this also helps with
		<a href="#" title="search engine optimization">search engine optimization</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Boxes everywhere</h3>
	<p>
		What we have now is a a jumbled mess of well-described information. The information needs to be bound together, with<br>relationships to other information. To begin with, each article is placed into a
		<code>&lt;div class="node"&gt;</code>. Now all information about an<br>
		article belongs together and all articles are equal, with hierarchy established by the physical order they are placed in.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, we uniquely identify each remaining information group, and encapsulate them in their own <code>&lt;div&rt;</code>.
		For instance:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>&lt;div id="advertisement"&rt;</code></li>
		<li><code>&lt;div id="header"&rt;</code></li>
		<li><code>&lt;div id="leftcolumn"&rt;</code></li>
		<li><code>&lt;div id="centercolumn"&rt;</code></li>
		<li><code>&lt;div id="footer"&rt;</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The purpose of boxing the information into <code>&lt;div&rt;</code> is so that information is logically grouped together, which
		makes shaping the<br>
		information easier. The CSS can now address each information group and assign attributes to it, such as layout and design. It’s
		not<br>
		necessarily semantic, but it is necessary for the presentation. Here’s the
		<a href="#" title="semantically organized example">semantically organized example</a>. There’s no CSS layout,<br>
		yet; it’s just structured markup.
	</p>
	<h3>The reconstruction of the skeleton</h3>
	<p>
		Now that each information group is identified by a <code>&lt;div&rt;</code>, the page is shaped with CSS so
		that the design matches the old look and<br>
		feel. This is a matter of time, patience, and practice. The first goal is not to mimic the old site, but to get things to
		position<br>
		themselves correctly in the three-column format with an overall header / masthead and footer. This becomes the first CSS file:
		<br>
		<code><a href="#" title="layout.css">layout.css</a></code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The benefit of positioning a page with a single CSS file is simple: you know where to look if there is a positioning problem.
		Often,<br>
		if you have a problem, it is usually with the positioning. In this step, we were mindful of the page’s behavior in a variety of
		<br>
		browsers, so we choose to utilize the <samp>@import</samp> feature, as any browsers that don’t support that directive will not
		get the layout. This<br>
		includes web-enabled cell phones, PDA devices, old browsers, and other Internet devices. Here’s the page
		<a href="#" title="with the positioning CSS applied">with the positioning CSS<br>
		applied</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Applying the skin</h3>
	<p>
		Now we have the page displaying the correct layout, but it still doesn’t look like Slashdot. The second CSS file that is
		attached is<br>
		the <code><a href="#" title="markup.css">markup.css</a></code>, which contains information about fonts, colors, background
		images, and the way lists are displayed. Here’s the<br>
		<a href="#" title="final example">final example</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		We also have the ability to add a <a href="#" title="second skin">second skin</a> if we want to give the user an option on how
		they want to view the page. The second<br>
		skin doesn’t have to duplicate all of the layout information, which should already be cached from the
		<code>layout.css</code> file.
	</p>
	<h3>The CSS link</h3>
	<p>
		We link the CSS files in the header to complete the transition.
	</p>
	<pre>&lt;head&rt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/layout.css" media='screen' /&rt;
  &lt;style type="text/css"&rt;
    @import "styles/markup.css";
  &lt;/style&rt;
&lt;/head&rt;</pre>
	<p>
		In this example, the <code>layout.css</code> file is linked with a media type of <code>screen</code>. This is intentional. The information there is only<br>
		important for display on a screen, it doesn’t have any benefit for printed media type, or any other (aural, tv, braille, etc.) for that<br>
		matter. The <code>markup.css</code> file, which is the “skin” of the page, is imported, and thus hidden from noncompliant web devices because<br>
		some of its features could be harmful or interpreted incorrectly.
	</p>
	<h3>Benefits!</h3>
	<p>
		The page will now correctly render in standards-compliant browsers, just as it did before, and will fail gracefully for non-standard<br>
		browsers. So, while the design is not as pretty in very old browsers, the content is still available to their users. It is also
		much cleaner<br>
		and more predictable with screen readers. By having the CSS fail gracefully, content is even available to PDAs and
		web<br>
		phones. Plus, there are no horizontal scroll bars! Finally, there is also a
		<a href="#" title="printer-friendly version">printer-friendly version</a> using only CSS (no separate<br>
		“printer-friendly” page). Perhaps the biggest benefit of this particular example is the bandwidth savings:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Savings per page without caching the CSS file: <em>~2KB per request</em></li>
		<li>Savings per page with caching the CSS file: <em>~9KB per request</em></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Though a few KB doesn't sound like a lot of bandwidth, let’s add it up. Slashdot’s FAQ, last updated 13 June 2000,
		<a href="#" title="states">states</a> that they<br>
		serve 50 million pages in a month. When you break down the figures, that’s ~1,612,900 pages per day or ~18 pages per
		second.<br>
		Bandwidth savings are as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Savings per day without caching the CSS files: <em>~3.15 GB bandwidth</em></li>
		<li>Savings per day <em>with</em> caching the CSS files: <em>~14 GB bandwidth</em></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Most Slashdot visitors would have the CSS file cached, so we could ballpark the daily savings at ~10 GB bandwidth. A high<br>
		volume of bandwidth from an ISP could be anywhere from $1-$5 cost per GB of transfer, but let's calculate it at $1 per GB for an
		<br>
		entire year. For this example, the <em>total yearly savings for Slashdot would be: $3,650</em> USD!
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Remember: this calculation is based on the number of pages served as of 13 June, 2000. I believe that Slashdot’s traffic is
		much<br>
		heavier now, but even using this three-year-old figure, the money saved is impressive.</em>

	<h3>The challenge</h3>
	<p>
		I now challenge the ALA community. We need a good web standards mechanic (or team of mechanics) to dig though
		Slashdot’s<br>
		engine, Slashcode, and make it web-standards-compliant. CmdrTaco has encouraged us to submit patches, and I know we can show<br>
		the benefits! The challenge is there - any takers?
